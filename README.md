# RSS-Reviews WordPress plugin

Use an RSS feed to display reviews on your WordPress site. Features a short code for dispalying feed on posts and pages, and a widget to dispaly reviews in your sidebar.

The widget uses a responsive slider to fade reviews in and out.

Works well for TripAdvisor Reviews.
